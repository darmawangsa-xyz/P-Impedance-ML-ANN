Prediction of P-Impedance Using Machine Learning, Case Study: F3 Field

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of technology that is currently being used because it is enough to help humans in carrying out tasks in various fields they are engaged in. One of the branches of Artificial Intelligence is Machine Learning with the ability to access and process data with their own rules, and by studying existing statistical algorithms and models. Machine Learning can certainly be developed for the world of geophysics. Geophysics is a branch of science that studies earth conditions with applicable physical principles. Of course, talking about the principles of physics will require various parameters such as density, conductivity, wave velocity, and so on. The number of parameters or physical properties that need to be understood will require excessive time and energy, therefore machine learning is needed to increase work effectiveness.

In the world of geophysics, measurements made are loaded into tables which are used as observational data. In this observation, data will also explain the subsurface rock conditions, the depth of the rock, and also the existing physical properties. This information is created a mathematical model that will be carried out by the inversion process. Inversion in the world of geophysics is very important, but inversion processing is difficult and requires more costs in the processing process.

Acoustic impedance is one of the physical properties of rocks that can affect the reflection of seismic waves. Scientifically, acoustic impedance is defined as the ability of rocks to pass seismic waves through them (Agus Abdullah, 2007). Rock porosity, fluid saturation, pressure, and temperature as well as lithology can affect acoustic impedance. Therefore, this acoustic impedance is used to determine the characteristics of rocks.

Objective of this project:
1. Predicting P-impdance using Machine Learning
2. Knowing and proving the process of applying Artificial Neural Network algorithms in estimating P-impedance value

Data:
There are several data used in this research, namely seismic data for Block F3 field which is 3D Post-stack seismic data, well log data, especially acoustic impdance log data. The data is obtained open source from terranubis.
